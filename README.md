## Steps included in the project  
1. Data loading : Loading the csv file into pandas dataframe to perform data manipulation
2. Data understanding : Understand the format and structure of the data,missing values, variable value count, etc
3. EDA : Find the hidden pattern from the data 
4. feature engineering : Creation of new features, updating the existing features, converting the feature suitable for performing machine learning algorithm 
5. Model loading (Linear regression, random forest and stacking (ensemble learning) 
6. Train test split : Split the data into 80 percent for training and 20 percent for testing purpose, for validating if the model is overfit or under fit 
7. model training: Training the model in the training dataset  
8. model evaluation : Evaluating the model on test dataset using metric like MSE, RMSE, MAE R2 score 
9. Overall best model evaluation : Selection of the best performing model best on the evaluation performed

### The RMSE, mean absolute error, and mean squared error scores of the Random Forest Regressor and Stacking Regressor were almost the same and lower than those of the Linear Regressor. This suggests better model performance in prediction, as the difference between the actual and predicted values is comparatively lower than that of the Linear Regressor.
